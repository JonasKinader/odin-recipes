        <p>Carbonara is made with guanciale (cured pork), eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese,
            <br> spaghetti pasta, and lots of black pepper. Italians don't add extra ingredients like cream,<br>
            milk, garlic, or onions. Try this recipe if you want to make an authentic,
            <br> creamy carbonara that comes straight from Italy, where I live. Buon appetito!

    <h2>What Is Spaghetti alla Carbonara?</h2>

        <p>Carbonara is a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork.
            <br> Its signature rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta.
            <br> The trick to making carbonara is making sure the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs,
            <br> but not so hot that they curdle.
